## Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The purpose of this analysis is to explore a dataset of Airbnb in Berlin with particular regard to the differences between the former East and West: 
1. _Are there any null values or outliers? How will you handle them?

2. _What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?

3. _Which marketing campaign was the most successful?

4. _What does the average customer look like?

5. _Which products are performing best?
